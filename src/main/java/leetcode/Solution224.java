     * A very easy way to solve the problem of associativity for - we tackled in the previous approach, is to
     * use - operator as the magnitude for the operand to the right of the operator. Once we start using - as a
     * magnitude for the operands, we just have one operator left which is addition and + is associative.
     *
     * for e.g. A - B - C could be re-written as A + (-B) + (-C).
     *
     * Time Complexity: O(N)
     * Space Complexity: O(N)
