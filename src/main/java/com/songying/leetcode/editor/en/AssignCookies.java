//Assume you are an awesome parent and want to give your children some cookies. 
//But, you should give each child at most one cookie. Each child i has a greed fac
//tor gi, which is the minimum size of a cookie that the child will be content wit
//h; and each cookie j has a size sj. If sj >= gi, we can assign the cookie j to t
//he child i, and the child i will be content. Your goal is to maximize the number
// of your content children and output the maximum number.
// 
//
// Note: 
//You may assume the greed factor is always positive. 
//You cannot assign more than one cookie to one child.
// 
//
// Example 1: 
// 
//Input: [1,2,3], [1,1]
//
//Output: 1
//
//Explanation: You have 3 children and 2 cookies. The greed factors of 3 childre
//n are 1, 2, 3. 
//And even though you have 2 cookies, since their size is both 1, you could only
// make the child whose greed factor is 1 content.
//You need to output 1.
// 
// 
//
// Example 2: 
// 
//Input: [1,2], [1,2,3]
//
//Output: 2
//
//Explanation: You have 2 children and 3 cookies. The greed factors of 2 childre
//n are 1, 2. 
//You have 3 cookies and their sizes are big enough to gratify all of the childr
//en, 
//You need to output 2.
